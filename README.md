# Hopping Window Mean Aggregation
This project demonstrates the use of a hopping window function to aggregate mean values of temperature readings in a distributed sensor system.

# Overview
In an enterprise distributed environment, the sensor system generates temperature readings every second. To increase throughput and reduce latency, the stream processor aggregates mean values of the sensor readings using a hopping window function.

# Hopping Window Function
The hopping window function is implemented in the Hoppingwindow_100periods-1.py file. This script creates a sample time series DataFrame with random values, applies a hopping window to calculate the mean, and visualizes the results.

# Parameters
window_size: Duration of the window (e.g., '3h' for a 3-hour window).
hop_size: Interval at which the window hops (e.g., '1h' for a 1-hour hop).
Example
The following example uses a window size of 3 hours and a hop size of 1 hour.

# Define hopping window parameters
window_size = '3h'  # Window duration
hop_size = '1h'     # Hop interval

# Create hopping windows
df['hopping_mean'] = df['value'].rolling(window=window_size, min_periods=1).mean().shift(-1)
Visualization
The script also includes a visualization of the original data and the hopping mean values.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(df['timestamp'], df['value'], label='Original Data')
plt.plot(df['timestamp'], df['hopping_mean'], label='Hopping Mean')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
Usage
Ensure you have pandas, numpy, and matplotlib installed.
Run the Hoppingwindow_100periods-1.py script.
The script will print the DataFrame with the hopping mean values and display a plot.
